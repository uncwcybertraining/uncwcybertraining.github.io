# Overview

This is the homepage for our Cybertraining for junior marine science researchers workshop at Wilmington NC, which was held in UNC Wilmington in 2023 and 2024.

# Background

	
Join us in NSF supported CyberTraining to Advance Data Acquisition, Processing, and Machine Learning based Modeling in Marine Science

The training program aims to advance the adoption of data science/machine learning cyber infrastructure by marine science researchers and enhance researchers' abilities in utilizing cyberinfrastructure tools. By participating in this training, you will be gaining interdisciplinary data science and machine learning skills to solve marine science research problems by working with marine science data. Your future research will be on cyberinfrastructure that can efficiently connect laboratories, share data and provide more computational power. So join and and get ready for your future research career!

To promote Eiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in marine sciences, we strongly encourage participation from researchers at community colleges and minority-serving institutions.

# Important Dates

UNC Wilmington

# Training Time

~~06/05/2023 - 06/09/2023~~

~~05/20/2024 - 05/24/2024~~

# What we offer

Training program participants will receive three meals daily and an up to $600 stipend, which can be used to support travel to and from Wilmington, NC. Free apartment-style dormitory housing will be provided to participants on UNCW’s campus. We can provide childcare support to individuals with family care responsibilities to attend.

# What you will learn

Successfully completing the program, workshop participants will:
- be able to use Python and related packages/toolkits for marine science data acquisition, analysis, and visualization
- gain basic Python programming skills (variables, loops, conditionals, etc.)
- have hands-on experience with machine learning and data science topics, and know how to apply them in solving marine science-related research questions
- get familiar with Cyberinfrastructure (CI) techniques, and migrate research projects from local machines to CI
- get familiar with version control with GitHub

# Eligibility
Seating is limited to 15 participants. The program is limited to currently enrolled graduate students (Master’s and Ph.D.) and undergraduate students (juniors and seniors as of Fall 2024) in marine science-related disciplines. Minorities and women are strongly encouraged to apply.
