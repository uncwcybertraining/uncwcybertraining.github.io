# Call for Participants

The training program aims to advance the adoption of data science/machine learning **cyber infrastructure** by marine science researchers and enhance researchers' abilities in utilizing
cyberinfrastructure tools. To enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the marine sciences, we strongly encourage participation from junior researchers at community colleges and minority-serving institutions.

Workshop participants will receive three meals daily and lodging. Each participant can also apply for a stipend of up to $600, which can be used to support travel to and from Wilmington, NC.

**Scope:**

Successfully completing the program, workshop participants will:
- be able to use Python and related packages/toolkits for marine science data acquisition, analysis, and visualization
- gain basic Python programming skills (variables, loops, conditionals, etc.)
- have hands-on experience with machine learning and data science topics, and know how to apply them in solving marine science-related research questions
- get familiar with Cyberinfrastructure (CI) techniques, and migrate research projects from local machines to CI
- get familiar with version control with GitHub

**Eligibility:**

Seating is limited to 15 participants. The program is limited to currently enrolled **graduate students** (Master’s and Ph.D.) and **undergraduate students** (juniors and seniors as of Fall 2024) in **marine science-related disciplines**.

**Important Dates**

**Application Window**: 02/01/2024 – 04/02/2024 (priority consideration date 03/04/2023)
**Notification Date**: On or before 04/15/2024
