# Call for Participants

The training program aims to advance the adoption of data science/machine learning **cyber infrastructure** by marine science researchers and enhance researchers' abilities in utilizing
cyberinfrastructure tools. To enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in marine sciences, we strongly encourage participation from junior researchers at community colleges and minority serving institutions.

Workshop participants will receive three meals daily and lodging, and each participant can apply for an up to $600 stipend, used to support travel to and from Wilmington, NC.

**Scope:**

We welcome submissions that explore the use of network approaches applied to studies in science of science. This includes (but is not limited to): **the analyses of relevant network data** (e.g., citation networks, collaboration networks, semantic networks, knowledge graphs), **development of novel methods for science of science applications** (e.g., graph embedding, link prediction), and **experimentations with representations** (e.g., hypergraph, multilayer graph). In addition, we seek submissions in the developing areas of exploration concerned with **the impact of diverse voices and intellectual backgrounds**, **political policies**, and **intelligences** (including Artificial Intelligence) on scientific advancements. 

The theme of submission this year is “**Science and Society**.” Submissions closer to the theme will be particularly welcome. The program committee will review the abstracts for the acceptance as either a contributed talk or a lightning talk in the spring. The Best Student Paper Award will be voted on at the workshop by the audience. Submissions cannot be those presented orally at other sessions in NetSci.

This workshop does not have archival proceedings. Therefore, submissions can be:
- be able to use Python and related packages/toolkits for marine science data acquisition, analysis, and visualization
- gain basic Python programming skills (variables, loops, conditionals, etc.)
- have hands-on experience with machine learning and data science topics, and know how to apply them in solving marine science-related research questions
- get familiar with Cyberinfrastructure (CI) techniques, and migrate research projects from local machines to CI
- get familiar with version control with GitHub

**Eligibility:**

Seating is limited to 15 participants. The program is limited to currently enrolled **graduate students** (Master’s and Ph.D.) and **undergraduate students** (juniors and seniors as of Fall 2024) in **marine science-related disciplines**.

**Important Dates**

**Application Window**: 02/01/2024 – 04/02/2024 (priority consideration date 03/04/2023)
**Notification Date**: On or before 04/15/2024
