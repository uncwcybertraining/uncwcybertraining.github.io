[Dr. Qianqian Liu](https://uncw.edu/profiles/l/liuq/) is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics and Physical Oceanography, as well as the Center for Marine Science, at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. She graduated from the University of Rhode Island with a PhD degree in Physical Oceanography in 2015. Before joining the academic community in North Carolina, Dr. Liu refined her skills as a postdoctoral fellow at the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, which is affiliated with the University of Michigan and Grand Valley State University. Her research is focused on coastal and estuarine hydrodynamics and biophysical processes (particularly how the physical processes influence biological processes) using numerical and machine learning modeling.

[Dr. Yang Song](https://uncw.edu/profiles/s/songy/) is an Associate Professor at the **Computer Science Department, UNCW**. His work mainly revolves around data science, data mining, and deep learning, but what really excites me is finding ways to apply machine learning and data mining to oceanography. His research goal is to improve forecasting methods and, along the way, tackle the unique machine learning challenges that come up in human learning and social science.
